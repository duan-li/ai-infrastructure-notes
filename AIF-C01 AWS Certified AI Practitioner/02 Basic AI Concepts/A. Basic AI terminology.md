#### **1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

- The broad field focused on creating systems that can perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence.
    
- Examples: perception, reasoning, decision-making.
    

#### **2. Machine Learning (ML)**

- A **subset of AI** that focuses on enabling systems to learn from data and improve performance over time.
    
- Used for specific tasks through data-driven methods.
    

#### **3. Neural Networks**

- Computational models inspired by the human brain.
    
- Consist of layers of nodes ("neurons") that process and transform input data into an output.
    
- Useful for pattern recognition and inference.
    

#### **4. Deep Learning**

- A **subset of ML** that uses multi-layered neural networks (deep neural networks).
    
- Automatically learns and extracts complex features from large datasets.
    
- Can handle more sophisticated tasks than standard neural networks.
    

#### **5. Computer Vision**

- An AI field that enables systems to **interpret and understand visual information** such as images and videos.
    

#### **6. Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

- A branch of AI that deals with **human language**.
    
- Applications: translation, text generation, interpretation, sentiment analysis, etc.
    

#### **7. AI Model**

- An algorithm trained on data to perform tasks like classification, prediction, and pattern recognition.
    
- Learns from examples in training data to improve performance.
    

#### **8. ML Algorithm**

- A set of procedures for analyzing data and making predictions or decisions based on patterns and insights.
    
- Used in specific ML tasks.
    

#### **9. AI Model Training**

- The process of **teaching a model** using large datasets so it can make accurate predictions or generate content.
    

#### **10. AI Inferencing**

- Using a trained model to **make predictions or decisions** based on learned patterns and knowledge.
    

#### **11. Model Fairness**

- Ensuring that an AI model’s decisions or predictions do not **disadvantage or bias** any group or individual.
    
- A principle of equitable and responsible AI.
    

#### **12. Model Fit**

- Describes how well a model’s predictions match the training data.
    
- Indicates whether the model accurately captures the underlying patterns.
    

#### **13. Large Language Model (LLM)**

- A type of AI model designed to **understand and generate human language**.
    
- Trained on massive text datasets.
    
- Capable of conversation, prediction, summarization, sentiment analysis, and more.
