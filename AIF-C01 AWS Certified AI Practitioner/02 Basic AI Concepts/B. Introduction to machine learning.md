Understanding how machine learning (ML) works involves following a step-by-step process, from collecting data to evaluating a trained model. Below is a breakdown of each stage in a generic ML workflow.

### **1. Data Collection & Preparation**

Data is the foundation of any machine learning project. Identifying and preparing appropriate, usable data is one of the most critical steps.

#### **Types of Data:**

- **Labeled Data**:  
    Data that includes tags or categories. Useful for supervised learning as it allows models to learn from known examples.
    
- **Unlabeled Data**:  
    Data without tags or predefined categories. Used in unsupervised learning, where the model identifies patterns on its own.
    
- **Tabular Data**:  
    Structured in rows and columns (e.g., spreadsheets or databases).
    
- **Time-Series Data**:  
    Sequential data collected over time with timestamps. Ideal for trend analysis or anomaly detection.
    
- **Image Data**:  
    Visual input in the form of images or videos. Useful for computer vision tasks like object detection and facial recognition.
    
- **Structured Text**:  
    Predefined format with tags or fields (e.g., CSV files, XML).
    
- **Unstructured Text**:  
    Free-form text like social media posts, articles, or PDF documents. Requires NLP to analyze.

### **2. Algorithm Selection**

Choosing the right machine learning algorithm depends on the task and data type. Some common algorithms include:

- **Linear Regression**:  
    Models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Example: predicting house prices.
    
- **Logistic Regression**:  
    Used for binary classification (e.g., spam or not spam).
    
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:  
    Classifies data based on the nearest labeled data points. Common in recommendation systems.
    
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:  
    Dimensionality reduction technique. Useful for summarizing large datasets while retaining key features, e.g., in facial recognition.

### **3. Model Training**

The model is trained on selected data. This step is often the most time- and resource-intensive.

#### **Training Approaches:**

- **Supervised Learning**:  
    Trained on labeled input-output pairs. Helps the model learn to predict outcomes for unseen data.
    
- **Unsupervised Learning**:  
    Uses unlabeled data. The model identifies hidden patterns, clusters, or relationships without guidance.
    
- **Reinforcement Learning**:  
    The model learns through trial and error, receiving rewards (positive or negative feedback) based on the outcomes of its decisions.

### **4. Model Evaluation**

After training, it’s essential to test and validate the model’s performance.

#### **Evaluation Methods:**

- **Batch Inferencing**:  
    Runs predictions on a large batch of data at once. Suitable when accuracy is more important than speed.
    
- **Real-Time Inferencing**:  
    Generates predictions immediately as input is received. Critical for applications needing quick responses (e.g., LLMs, self-driving cars).

### **5. Iteration**

The evaluation results often uncover insights that require going back to the beginning — revisiting data collection, refining the data, or tweaking the algorithm — to improve performance. Machine learning is an iterative cycle.
