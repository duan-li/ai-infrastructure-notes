#### **Part 1: Choosing a Generative Model for High-Quality Image Creation**

**Scenario**  
Media company needs a model that can generate diverse, high-resolution, controllable images (custom artwork, logos).

|Option|Model Type|Suitability for the Scenario|
|---|---|---|
|**A. LLM**|Text-only; not designed for images|✗|
|**B. GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)**|Can create images but often struggles with fine detail and consistent control|✗|
|**C. VAE (Variational Autoencoder)**|Generates lower-fidelity images; better for anomaly detection/compression|✗|
|**D. **Diffusion Model****|Purpose-built for photorealistic, high-detail image synthesis; supports attribute control via prompts or conditioning|**✓ Correct**|

**Answer → Diffusion Model**

#### **Part 2: Identifying the Current Foundation-Model Lifecycle Stage**

**Scenario Recap**

- Model **already selected**
    
- Large conversational dataset collected
    
- **Pre-training finished** on general language patterns
    
- Team is **now adapting** model to specific customer queries
    
- Evaluation, deployment, and feedback stages still ahead
    

|Lifecycle Stage|Description|Fits Scenario?|
|---|---|---|
|**Model Selection**|Pick architecture & config|Already completed|
|**Fine-Tuning**|Further train pre-trained model on domain-specific data|**✓ Matches current work**|
|**Deployment**|Release model to production|Not yet|
|**Feedback**|Post-deployment monitoring & iteration|Not yet|

**Answer → Fine-Tuning**

**Summary**

1. **Diffusion models** are best for controllable, high-quality image generation.
    
2. The chatbot team is in the **fine-tuning** stage of the foundation-model lifecycle.
