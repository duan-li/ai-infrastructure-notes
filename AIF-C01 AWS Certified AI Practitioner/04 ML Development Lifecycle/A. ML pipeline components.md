Before diving into MLOps, it’s important to understand the full **machine learning (ML) lifecycle**. Each phase—from defining the business goal to monitoring models in production—plays a crucial role in building effective ML systems.

---

### **1. Business Goal Definition**

- **Start of the lifecycle**: Define the **business objective**.
    
- Determine whether ML is the right tool to solve the problem.
    
- Involves:
    
    - Business considerations and ROI
        
    - Problem framing: what are we optimizing?
        
    - Cost, feasibility, and production deployment readiness
        

---

### **2. Problem Framing**

- Define **what is observed** and **what should be predicted**.
    
- Identify:
    
    - **Inputs and outputs**
        
    - **Dependent and independent variables**
        

---

### **3. Data Collection**

- First step of the **data processing pipeline**.
    
- Includes:
    
    - **Labeling** the data (if needed)
    - **Ingestion** via batch or streaming
    - **Aggregation** into storage systems
        

---

### **4. Data Preprocessing**

- Transform and prepare raw data for model training.
    
- Tasks include:
    
    - **Cleaning** and **partitioning** the data
        
    - **Scaling** numeric values
        
    - **Detecting and correcting bias**
        
    - **Data augmentation** to improve balance or diversity

### **5. Feature Engineering**

Features are the inputs to ML models. Feature engineering improves model accuracy and efficiency.

#### Subcomponents:

- **Feature Selection**: Choose relevant features to minimize model error.
    
- **Feature Transformation**: Replace or scale missing/invalid features.
    
- **Feature Creation**: Generate new features from existing data.
    
- **Feature Extraction**: Apply dimensionality reduction techniques.
    

---

### **6. Model Training, Tuning & Evaluation**

- **Model Training**: Feed training data into the algorithm so it learns patterns.
    
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjust settings that control algorithm behavior to optimize performance.
    

#### Model Evaluation:

- **Offline Evaluation**: Use a **holdout set** (unseen portion of data) to test model performance.
    
- Validate that the model gives correct results **without prior exposure** to evaluation data.
    

---

### **7. Model Deployment**

- Make the trained model **available for use** in applications or services.
    
- This step often integrates directly with **MLOps practices**.
    
- Supports both **batch** and **real-time inferencing**.
    

---

### **8. Model Monitoring**

Post-deployment, ongoing monitoring ensures model performance and reliability.

#### Key Components:

- **Explainability**: Ability to interpret and explain model outputs.
    
- **Drift Detection**:
    
    - **Data Drift**: Input distribution changes
        
    - **Concept Drift**: Output behavior changes
        
- **Alerting & Retraining**:
    
    - Set **thresholds** to trigger model updates
        
    - Automatically retrain or fine-tune when performance drops

## **Conclusion**

Understanding each phase of the ML lifecycle—from goal setting to monitoring—provides the foundation for effective **MLOps**, ensuring that models are not only accurate but also scalable, maintainable, and valuable to the business.
