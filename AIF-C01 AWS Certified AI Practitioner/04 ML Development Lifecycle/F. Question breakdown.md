### Question Breakdown — ML Lifecycle Step for Managing Playlist Data

**Scenario (restated)**

- App: Music-playlist recommender
    
- Data handled in the workflow: **song ratings, listening duration, listener demographics**
    
- Question: _Which ML-lifecycle step best describes this workflow?_
    
    - **A. Feature Engineering**
        
    - **B. Train, Tune, and Evaluate**
        
    - **C. Collect Data**
        
    - **D. Pre-process Data**

#### Quick Definitions of the Options

|Choice|Lifecycle Step|Core Activity|
|---|---|---|
|**A. Feature Engineering**|Selecting, creating, and managing the **input features** used in training/inference (often stored in a Feature Store)||
|**B. Train, Tune, and Evaluate**|Building the model, hyper-parameter tuning, and measuring accuracy/performance||
|**C. Collect Data**|Labeling, ingesting, and aggregating raw data before further processing||
|**D. Pre-process Data**|Cleaning, partitioning, scaling, and other transformations applied to raw data||

#### Elimination & Selection Logic

1. **Collect Data (C)**
    
    - Focuses on _gathering_ or _labeling_ raw data.
        
    - Does **not** cover ongoing management of specific attributes already chosen as inputs.
        
2. **Pre-process Data (D)**
    
    - Covers transformations like cleaning or scaling.
        
    - Not about **defining** or **tracking** which attributes become model inputs.
        
3. **Train, Tune, Evaluate (B)**
    
    - Centers on building and validating the model itself, _after_ features are prepared.
        
4. **Feature Engineering (A)**
    
    - Explicitly about **defining, curating, and versioning** the inputs (features) the model will consume.
        
    - Managing song ratings, listening duration, and listener demographics fits squarely here.

### **Correct Lifecycle Step → Feature Engineering (Option A)**

These user-behavior attributes become _features_ that the recommendation model ingests; handling them is therefore part of **Feature Engineering** in the ML lifecycle.




### Question Breakdown — Choosing the Best Metric for a Spam-Classification Model

**Scenario (restated)**

- Task: Build a model that classifies emails as **spam** or **not spam** (binary classification).
    
- Need: Pick the **most appropriate evaluation metric**.
    

**Candidate Metrics**

1. **F1 Score**
    
2. **AUC-ROC**
    
3. **RSE (Mean-Squared Error)**
    
4. **R² (Coefficient of Determination)**
    

---

#### Quick Definitions & Fit for the Task

|Metric|What It Measures|Classification Relevance|Key Pros / Cons for Spam-Filtering|
|---|---|---|---|
|**F1 Score**|Harmonic mean of precision & recall|Yes (binary)|Addresses class imbalance (many ham vs. few spam). However, it gives only a single threshold-dependent value and doesn’t show the full trade-off curve.|
|**AUC-ROC**|Area under the ROC curve (plots True-Positive-Rate vs. False-Positive-Rate across all thresholds)|**Yes (binary)**|Measures overall ability to rank spam above non-spam; threshold-independent and highlights FP vs. FN trade-offs — ideal for email filtering.|
|**RSE (MSE)**|Squared error between predicted & true numeric values|No (regression only)|Irrelevant for a discrete spam/not-spam outcome.|
|**R²**|Proportion of variance explained (regression fit)|No (regression only)|Not suited to binary classification.|

---

#### Elimination Logic

- **RSE** and **R²** → Designed for regression problems → **Eliminate**.
    
- **F1 Score** → Useful with class imbalance but still threshold-specific and less informative about overall ranking power.
    
- **AUC-ROC** → Directly evaluates how well the model separates the two classes **across all thresholds**; widely accepted for binary classifiers like spam filters.
    

---

### **Correct Metric: AUC-ROC (Option B)**

- Captures the full spectrum of trade-offs between **false positives** (ham marked as spam) and **false negatives**(spam missed).
    
- Threshold-independent, making it robust for selecting an operating point later.
    
- Higher AUC (> 0.9) signals a strong classifier; 0.5 equals random guessing.

**Bottom line:** For evaluating a spam-classification model, **AUC-ROC provides the most informative and appropriate measure of performance.**
