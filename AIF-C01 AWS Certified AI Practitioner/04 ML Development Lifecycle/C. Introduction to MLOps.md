**MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)** is a set of practices that combines machine learning with principles from **DevOps**, but extends them to account for the unique needs of ML systems, including data, model lifecycle, and governance.

### **Similarities and Differences with DevOps**

#### **Shared Concepts:**

1. **Version Control**
    
    - Applied to **data**, **code**, and **models**
        
    - Repositories should be **independent and isolated**
        
2. **Automation**
    
    - Automate tasks wherever human oversight isn't explicitly required
        
    - Enhances **repeatability** and **quality**
        
3. **CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)**
    
    - Expanded in MLOps to cover **data pipelines**, **model training**, and **model deployment**
        
4. **Model Governance**
    
    - Focuses on **evaluation**, **transparency**, and **ethical oversight**
        
    - Checks for **bias**, **fairness**, and **compliance**

### **Benefits of MLOps**

- **Productivity**:  
    Faster evaluations with automated, self-service tooling.
    
- **Reliability**:  
    Consistent, high-quality processes reduce the need for troubleshooting.
    
- **Repeatability**:  
    Automated pipelines produce predictable, consistent results.
    
- **Auditability**:  
    All inputs and outputs are version-controlled and trackable for audit purposes.
    
- **Data and Model Quality**:  
    Automated validation and guardrails help maintain high quality.

### **MLOps Lifecycle Phases**

Each step in the ML lifecycle maps to a specific pipeline in the MLOps system:

---

#### **1. Data Pipeline**

- Includes **data preparation and pre-processing**
    
- Data is version-controlled and stored in a **data repository**
    

---

#### **2. Build and Test Pipeline**

- Steps:
    
    - **Feature engineering**
        
    - **Model training**
        
    - **Model evaluation**
        
- Code is stored in a **code repository**
    
- Results support **model selection**
    

---

#### **3. Deployment Pipeline**

- Deploy the selected model to production
    
- Uses a **model repository** (separate from data/code repos) to track selected and deployed models
    

---

#### **4. Monitoring Pipeline**

- Continuously monitors the deployed model
    
- Evaluates model **performance**, **drift**, and **accuracy**
    
- Ensures ongoing **model health** and initiates retraining if necessary

## **Conclusion**

MLOps integrates automation, versioning, monitoring, and governance across the ML lifecycle. By structuring data, code, and models into dedicated pipelines and repositories, MLOps ensures scalable, auditable, and reliable machine learning in production environments.
