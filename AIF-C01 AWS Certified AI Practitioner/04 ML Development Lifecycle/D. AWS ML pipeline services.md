**Amazon SageMaker** is a fully managed service that supports the **end-to-end machine learning lifecycle**, including data preparation, model training, deployment, and monitoring. Here's how different components of SageMaker fit into an ML pipeline:

---

### **Key SageMaker Features by Lifecycle Phase**

---

### üßπ **1. Data Preparation**

#### **SageMaker Data Wrangler**

- A **low/no-code** tool to prepare, clean, and visualize data
    
- Works via a web UI‚Äîideal for non-coders
    
- Enables data analysis and feature transformation
    

#### **SageMaker Feature Store**

- Stores and manages **ML features** used for training and inference
    
- Supports **data ingestion**, **transformation**, and **time-travel** (revisiting historical feature values)
    

---

### üèãÔ∏è **2. Model Training and Tuning**

#### **SageMaker Training**

- Scalable infrastructure for training **large or multiple models**
    
- Supports **built-in or custom algorithms**
    
- Manages compute, storage, and scaling

---

### üìä **4. Post-Deployment Monitoring and Management**

#### **SageMaker Model Monitor**

- Monitors model performance **in production**
    
- Supports:
    
    - **Real-time** and **batch** monitoring
        
    - Scheduled **asynchronous evaluation jobs**
        
    - Drift detection and alerting
        

#### **SageMaker Pipelines**

- **Orchestrates** the entire ML workflow
    
- Purpose-built for **MLOps**
    
- Connects all stages: from data prep to monitoring
    
- Offers **scalability and extensibility**
