|#|Advantage|What It Means|Example Uses|
|---|---|---|---|
|**1**|**Adaptability**|A single foundation model can switch among text, image, audio, or code tasks with minimal re-engineering.|One model handles both chatbot responses and product-image generation.|
|**2**|**Responsiveness**|With adequate compute, generative AI returns answers or content **near real time**.|Instant support-bot replies; on-the-fly image edits.|
|**3**|**Simplicity**|Transforms complex inputs into concise, digestible outputs.|Summaries of long reports; plain-English explanations; scaffolded code generation from natural language.|
|**4**|**Creativity & Exploration**|Produces novel art, music, designs, and copy by recombining learned patterns.|Rapid logo prototypes; mood-board imagery; song-lyric drafts.|
|**5**|**Data Efficiency**|Fine-tunes on relatively small, domain-specific datasets yet generalises well via powerful pre-training.|Custom legal document assistant trained on a few thousand contracts.|
|**6**|**Personalisation**|Tailors output to individual context, history, or preferences.|Adaptive learning content; chatbots that remember prior conversation details.|
