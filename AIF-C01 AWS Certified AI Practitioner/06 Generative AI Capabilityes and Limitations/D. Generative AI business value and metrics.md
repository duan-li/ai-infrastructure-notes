#### 1. What counts as “business value”?

- **Broad, context-dependent concept**: can be financial (revenue), operational (efficiency), or customer-centric (experience/loyalty).
    
- **Goal:** Ensure the AI initiative aligns with—and demonstrably advances—overall business objectives.

#### 2. Four Metric Families

|Family|Key Metric(s)|What It Measures|Why It Matters|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Performance**|**Cross-Domain Performance**|Ability of a single model to serve multiple use-cases (e.g., support **and** sales chat).|High score ⇒ fewer bespoke models → lower maintenance & faster rollouts.|
|**Efficiency**|**Latency & Resource Utilisation**|Time, memory, and compute consumed in training & inference.|Faster answers and smaller infra bills improve ROI and user satisfaction.|
|**Revenue**|**Conversion Rate**& **ARPU**|— Conversion: % users completing a desired action  <br>— ARPU: average yearly revenue per user|Direct linkage to sales; uptick validates AI spend.|
|**Customer-Centric**|**Accuracy** & **CLV**|— Accuracy: rate of “acceptable on first draft” outputs  <br>— CLV: lifetime revenue from a customer|Fewer human corrections, higher retention, stronger brand loyalty.|

#### 3. Illustrative Examples

|Use-Case|Relevant Metric|AI-Driven Impact|
|---|---|---|
|Customer-support chatbot|Cross-domain performance|Same bot handles billing + tech support → single model, reduced ops burden.|
|Product recommendation engine|Conversion rate|More personalised suggestions → higher checkout completion.|
|Marketing copy generator|Accuracy|First-draft content ready 80 % of the time → lower agency costs.|
|Personalised loyalty app|CLV|Tailored offers extend average customer lifetime by 15 %.|

#### 4. Putting It Into Practice

1. **Select metrics** that tie directly to strategic goals (e.g., growth, margin, CX).
    
2. **Baseline current performance** before AI deployment.
    
3. **Instrument** your pipeline to capture chosen metrics automatically.
    
4. **Iterate**—use metric movement (positive or negative) to guide fine-tuning or rollbacks.
    
5. **Communicate results** in business terms (e.g., $ lift, cost saved, NPS points gained).

**Bottom line:** Clear, goal-aligned metrics—spanning performance, efficiency, revenue, and customer impact—transform generative-AI from “interesting tech” into a demonstrable business asset.
